Bugs:
    1) utf-8 paths must be tested and supported.
    2) Display of EXIF comments need to be tested.
       Both Unicode & ASCII need testing.

New features needed:
    1) Should switch to a multi-line editor for comments.  Support "\n".
    2) Should autodetect if the jpeg COM is in utf-8 format. 
    3) Allow editing the EXIF "Orientation" flag (without rewriting the exif header).
    4) Extract and return the EXIF thumbnail, oriented properly, as an alternative
       to the much slower process of generating a new thumbnail.

Future features:
    1) Allow the user to erase or move comment in either the EXIF or jpeg COM.
    2) Play or return audio files associated with the exif.
